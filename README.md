# VAST-Mini-Challenge-2-2016
This repository contains the code of the visualizations for the attempt to solve and learn from the VAST Mini challenge 2.

## Description

This project is focused on the Tamara Munzner methodology of What, Why and How teached by the professor John Alexis Guerra ([http://johnguerra.co/](http://johnguerra.co/)) in the 24 hour seminar of Data Vizualition from the UTP (Universidad Tecnol√≥gica de Pereira) to attack the Challenge found in the Visual Analytics Community page ([http://vacommunity.org/2016+VAST+Challenge%3A+MC2](http://vacommunity.org/2016+VAST+Challenge%3A+MC2)), my personal objective is to present the final project for the seminar applying the key concepts learned in class and use a particular set of web tecnologies to accomplish a list of defined task that the visualization must resolve.

## Technologies
I will attemp to implement the visualizations in D3.js mainly to learn, and use others to support the interaction and presentation.
